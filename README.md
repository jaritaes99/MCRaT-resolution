# MCRaT-resolution
Notebooks used to analyze different resolution outcomes in MCRaT.

Each directory contains the .ipynb notebook files, html files or pdf files depending on the directory name.

The MCRaT output files are available for download in the following link:

https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8044746

The CHOMBO directory should be located within the MCRaT-resolution directory for the notebooks to work. The file has a spherical-outflow directory, where all the different simulations of a spherical outflow at different resolutions are located and a science directory, containing all the simulations of the 16TI Progenitor model GRB.
